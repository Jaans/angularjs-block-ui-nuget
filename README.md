angularjs-block-ui-nuget
========================

The goal of this is to wrap the AngularJs BlockUI directive from https://github.com/McNull/angular-block-ui in a NuGet package for Visual Studio consumption.

The directive is based on the jQuery BlockUI plugin from https://github.com/malsup/blockui/
